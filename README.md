# Ferris-Wheel-CG-Project
<HR></HR><BR><BR>
This project contains Ferris Wheel. When the user presses ‘c/C’ key, wheel will start rotating and vice-versa. The user can control the speed of rotation by pressing ‘v/V’ or ‘x/X’ keys from keyboard where ‘v/V’ increases the speed and ‘x/X’ decreases the speed. When the user press ‘w/W’,’s/S’, ’a/A’ & ’d/D’ key, it will rotate the whole wheel into Top, Bottom, Right and Left direction respectively. These are showed in the System-Architecture. The user can also increase and decrease the number of cabins by pressing key ‘+/1’ and ‘-/0’ respectively. This project is purely made for university purpose. Any student who are studying BE and B.Tech in CSE can use it as their Computer Graphics Mini Project. If you're a VTU student and specially Global Academy of Technology's stduent then congratulations you've a perfectly made project and I'll be proud on you if you modify this project and implement something extra in it rather than just copy-paste. Thank You, guys.
